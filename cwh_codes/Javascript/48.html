    Hi Guys
    <script>
        console.log("Hi Namaste");

        // JS use dynamic typing, no need to give type
        var a = 10;
        var b = 2;
        var name = "pushkar";
        console.log(name);

        // Operators in JavaScript
        // Operand - entities on which operators operate
        // In 3 + 4 '+' is the operator and 3,4 are operands

        // 1. unary operator - It has single operand (x = -x)
        // Examples of unary operator
        // c = -c;

        // 2. binary operator - It has two operand (x = x+6)
        // Examples of binary operator
        // c = 456+8;

        // Arithmetic operator
        console.log("sum of a + b is                 "    +    (a + b));
        console.log("subtraction of a - b is         "    +    (a - b));
        console.log("multiplication of a * b is      "    +    (a * b));
        console.log("division of a / b is            "    +    (a / b));
        console.log("exponential of  a**b is         "    +    (a ** b));

        console.log("the value of b++ gonna be      " + (b++));
        // the above statement will only increase the value by one but it will not print the generated value

        console.log("the value of ++b gonna be      " + (++b));
        // the above statement will increase the value by one and  it will print the generated value in console

        console.log("the value of b-- gonna be      " + (b--));
        // the above statement will only decrease the value by one but it will not print the generated value

        console.log("the value of --b gonna be      " + (--b));
      // the above statement will decrease the value by one and  it will print the generated value in console
