    A computer is a digital electronic machine that can be programmed to carry out sequences of arithmetic or
    logical operations (computation) automatically. Modern computers can perform generic sets of operations known as
    programs. These programs enable computers to perform a wide range of tasks. A computer system is a "complete"
    computer that includes the hardware, operating system (main software), and peripheral equipment needed and used
    for "full" operation. This term may also refer to a group of computers that are linked and function together,
    such as a computer network or computer cluster.

    A broad range of industrial and consumer products use computers as control systems. Simple special-purpose
    devices like microwave ovens and remote controls are included, as are factory devices like industrial robots and
    computer-aided design, as well as general-purpose devices like personal computers and mobile devices like
    smartphones. Computers power the Internet, which links billions of other computers and users.

    Early computers were meant to be used only for calculations. Simple manual instruments like the abacus have
    aided people in doing calculations since ancient times. Early in the Industrial Revolution, some mechanical
    devices were built to automate long tedious tasks, such as guiding patterns for looms. More sophisticated
    electrical machines did specialized analog calculations in the early 20th century. The first digital electronic
    calculating machines were developed during World War II. The first semiconductor transistors in the late 1940s
    were followed by the silicon-based MOSFET (MOS transistor) and monolithic integrated circuit (IC) chip
    technologies in the late 1950s, leading to the microprocessor and the microcomputer revolution in the 1970s. The
    speed, power and versatility of computers have been increasing dramatically ever since then, with transistor
    counts increasing at a rapid pace (as predicted by Moore's law), leading to the Digital Revolution during the
    late 20th to early 21st centuries. Click on p to see the use of On Method.
